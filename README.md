# The part where I write the prologue
Today is April 30th 2025. Complexity!.js is finished, Complexity: Forever is in the works!
If you don't know what are complex numbers, what are you doing here?
Well, just knowing i^2 = 1 and basic trigonometry will do. (I hope)

# The part where I explain the Complexity extension
Complexity uses Rawify's code and ClickerTale_2's coding help to allow Complex Numbers on TurboWarp.
Just write the numbers and it'll do the math!

## Complexity!
The classic. The definitive. The basic, yet complex.
Plannig on writing a doc for this, maybe.
### What's that block?
Whenever you don't know what's a block supposed to do, first try to read it.
But there are some blocks that NEED explanation:
The root block finds a root. (3)root(64)=4. But now, with complex numbers.
The Magnitude_of(x) block is the absolute value of x. Mag(x)^2 = Re(x)^2 + Im(x)^2
The Sign_of(x) normalizes x: Sign(x)*Mag(x)=x
The e(x) block is for the natural exponent. For -1, try e(6.28318530718i). e(1)=Math.E
The ln(x) block is for the natural logarithm. 
The (x)pi block multiplies x with pi. For a full turn, try (2i)pi. (1)pi = ()pi = Math.PI
