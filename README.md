Today is April 11th 2025. Complexity is in version 1.1
If you don't know what are complex numbers, what are you doing here?
Well, just knowing i^2 = 1 and basic trigonometry will do.

# The part where I explain the Complexity extension
Complexity uses Rawify's code and ClickerTale_2's coding help to allow Complex Numbers on TurboWarp.
Just write the numbers and it'll do the math!
